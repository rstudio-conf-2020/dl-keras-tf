# Text is a sequence of information

.pull-right[

Sometimes our context is nearby:

_.center[I grew up in .blue[France] and speak .red[French]]_

<br>

Sometimes we need distant context:

_.center[My father worked for the .blue[French] retailer .blue[Carrefour] and I
grew up in a little village called .blue[La Roque-Gageac], which is on the north
bank of the .blue[Dordogne River]. Consequently, I learned to speak .red[French]]_

# Hidden state

.pull-left[

This passing of information from previous states is what we call the
.blue[___hidden state___].

It is common for the hidden state to be analogized to .blue[memory].

# Hidden state

.pull-left[

1. The previous hidden state and the current state input are combined to form a
vector. That vector now has information on the current input and previous inputs. 

2. The vector goes through the __tanh__ activation, 

3. The output is the new hidden state, or the memory of the network.

# Weights

The .blue[weights] of the network will determine what parts of the sequence to
emphasize (aka .blue[_remember_]) to accurately predict what comes next.

# Multiple units

.pull-left[

The number of units we specify in a recurrent layer is analogous to [feature maps](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/dl-keras-tf/04-computer-vision-cnns.html#18)
in CNNs. 

* Each unit will be a full sequence of RNN cells

* Each unit will have its own weight matrix

* Results in different features of the sequence to be emphasized

# Vanishing gradient

.pull-left.font90[

* When doing back propagation, each node in a layer calculates its gradient with
  respect to the effects of the gradients in the layer before it.

* If the adjustments to the layers before it is small, then adjustments to the
  current layer will be even smaller.
  
* This causes gradients to ___exponentially shrink___ as they back propagate

* Small gradients mean small adjustments, which causes the early layers not to learn.

# Forget gate

.pull-left[

* Information from the previous hidden state and information from the current input is passed through the sigmoid activation function. 

* Values come out between 0 and 1
   - closer to 0 means to forget
   - closer to 1 means to remember

# Input gate

.pull-left[

* Step 1: 
   - `sigmoid(hidden state + current input)`
   - decides which values we’ll update

* Step 2:
   - `tahn(hidden state + current input)`
   - creates vector of new candidate info to be added to the state

* Step 3:
   - `Step 1 output x Step 2 output`

# Cell state

.pull-left[

* Use outputs of previous gates to update current cell state

* The cell state gets pointwise multiplied by the forget vector. This has a possibility of dropping values in the cell state if it gets multiplied by values near 0. 

* Then we take the output from the input gate and do a pointwise addition which updates the cell state to new values that the neural network finds relevant.
